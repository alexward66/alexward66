- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alex.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, AI and Machine Learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Statistical Analysis in Python.
- ðŸ“« Reach me by email: alex_ward66@hotmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: I like documentation, commenting code, and writing user guides.
  - Am I special? Maybe. I'm just trying to be thorough.
- âš¡ FYI: I'm new here, and new to the concept of open source in general.
  - Be nice, this is mostly a way for me to re-learn Git while having a cloud based storage for my code snippets.
